This package is used to prepare the data for, and conduct the estimation of, transmission models for yellow fever in Africa. The methods for the two individual models are given in Garske et al. 2014 and Jean et al. 2018 whilst the product space estimation details are given in Gaythorpe et al. 2019.

There are vignettes provided for the estimation of the ecological niche model, estimation of the two transmission models of yellow fever seroprevalence and further vignettes describing processing the posterior samples and estimating the transmission intensities across the African endemic region.

Any questions should be directed to Dr Gaythorpe at k.gaythorpe AT imperial.ac.uk.
