Description: Estimates ecological niche model (GLM) and two transmission models (SERO) for yellow fever. 
    The GLM is estimated using conventional MCMC and the two transmission models are 
    estimated with product space MCMC allowing the user to find the model evidence for one 
    relative to the other. Models are based on Garske et al. (2014) and Jean et al. (2019).
